## 🚀 Testing

npm run serve:static
```

Then visit `http://localhost:3000` and verify:

## 📝 Notes

### Review Submission
Since this is a static site, users cannot submit new reviews directly. Options:
1. Use a form service like Formspree, Netlify Forms, or Google Forms
2. Use email (mailto:) for review submissions
3. Integrate with a third-party review service

### Contact Form
The contact form now uses `mailto:` which opens the user's default email client. For better UX, consider:
- Using Formspree (free tier available)
- Using Netlify Forms (if deploying to Netlify)
- Using a serverless function (if using Cloudflare Workers)

### Review Ratings
Review helpful/not-helpful ratings are stored in browser localStorage. They:
- ✅ Work immediately (no server needed)
- ✅ Persist per browser
- ❌ Don't sync across devices
- ❌ Don't persist if localStorage is cleared

For production, consider:
- Using a third-party service (Disqus, etc.)
- Using Cloudflare Workers for simple API
- Using a serverless function
